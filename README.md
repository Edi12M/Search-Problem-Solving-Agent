Bin Truck ai model .
Bin Truck
A truck must collect bins placed at nodes of weighted graph. The truck has a limited capacity and may unload at recycling stations. Actions include: move, collect and unload. The goal is to collect all bins. The states are position, load and a collected set.
So to wrap it up we have :
💡Goal : Collect all the bins.
🚛 Actions: Move, collect and unload.
♻️ States: position, load and collected set.
This problem implements a capacity-constrained waste collection domain and Uniform-Cost Search (UFC), A* with just routing heuristic, and A*with a capacity-aware heuristic are used to compare and find the optimal search algorithm.
